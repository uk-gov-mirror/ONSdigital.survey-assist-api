# Survey Assist API

The Survey Assist API - Used to access backend data processing services such as classification

## Overview

The Survey Assist API implemented in Fast API

## Features

- Fast API with endpoints for lookup and classification of SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) and SOC (Standard Occupational Classification)
- **Rephrasing Toggle**: Control SIC and SOC description rephrasing (where rephrase data exists) via API options for testing and development
- **Firestore Integration**: Store survey results and feedback data in Google Cloud Firestore
- **List Results Endpoint**: Query survey results
- Infrastructure defined in Terraform, deployed to GCP Cloud Run via CI/CD (Cloud Build)
- Uses the following cloud services:
  - Cloud Run
  - API Gateway
  - Firestore Database
  - JWT Authentication with backend API
  - CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [ ] Python 3.12 (Recommended: use `pyenv` to manage versions)
- [ ] `poetry` (for dependency management)
- [ ] Colima (if running locally with containers)
- [ ] Terraform (for infrastructure management)
- [ ] Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`) with appropriate permissions

### Local Development Setup

The Makefile defines a set of commonly used commands and workflows.  Where possible use the files defined in the Makefile.

#### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ONSdigital/survey-assist-api.git
cd survey-assist-api
```

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
poetry install
```

#### Set Enviornment Variables

The API supports the following environment variables:

- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: Google Cloud Project ID
- `FIRESTORE_DB_ID`: Firestore Database ID
- `SIC_VECTOR_STORE`: URL of the vector store service
- `SIC_VECTOR_STORE_AUTH_ENABLED`: Defaults to True. Set to False when the vector store runs locally or is a side-car deployment alongside the API in Cloud Run
- `SIC_LOOKUP_DATA_PATH`: Path to SIC lookup data file
- `SIC_REPHRASE_DATA_PATH`: Path to SIC rephrase data file 
- `SOC_VECTOR_STORE`: URL of the vector store service
- `SOC_VECTOR_STORE_AUTH_ENABLED`: Defaults to True. Set to False when the vector store runs locally or is a side-car deployment alongside the API in Cloud Run
- `SOC_REPHRASE_DATA_PATH`: Optional path to SOC rephrase data file; if unset, packaged example data from `soc-classification-library` is used.
- `SOC_LOOKUP_DATA_PATH`: Optional path to SOC lookup CSV; if unset, packaged example data from `soc-classification-library` is used.

##### Survey Assist running locally, one or more vector services running in GCP

To run the Survey Assist API **locally** and the SIC and SOC vector stores in **GCP** you must:

- Have the Service Account Token Creator role on your developer IAM
- Impersonate the API cloud run service account to ensure authentication to the vector stores
```gcloud auth application-default login --impersonate-service-account=API-CLOUD-RUN-SA``` 
- Set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS= json generated using the above _gcloud auth_ command
- Set one or both vector services to have auth enabled:
  - ```export SOC_VECTOR_STORE_AUTH_ENABLED=true```
  - ```export SIC_VECTOR_STORE_AUTH_ENABLED=true```
- Set one or both services GCP URL (see cloud run details in console):
  - ```export SIC_VECTOR_STORE=https://URL-TO-SIC-VECTOR-SERVICE```
  - ```export SOC_VECTOR_STORE=https://URL-TO-SOC-VECTOR-SERVICE```

##### Survey Assist running locally, vector services running locally

To run the Survey Assist API, SIC and SOC vector stores in **locally** you must:

- Set both vector services to have auth disabled:
  - ```export SOC_VECTOR_STORE_AUTH_ENABLED=false```
  - ```export SIC_VECTOR_STORE_AUTH_ENABLED=false```
- By default the API will assume the vector store is local:
  - ```unset SIC_VECTOR_STORE```
  - ```unset SOC_VECTOR_STORE```

#### Run the Application Locally

To run the application locally execute:

```bash
make run-api
```

### Code Quality

Code quality and static analysis will be enforced using isort, black, ruff, mypy and pylint. Security checking will be enhanced by running bandit.

To check the code quality, but only report any errors without auto-fix run:

```bash
make check-python-nofix
```

To check the code quality and automatically fix errors where possible run:

```bash
make check-python
```

### Documentation

Documentation is available in the docs folder and can be viewed using mkdocs

```bash
make run-docs
```

### Testing

Pytest is used for testing alongside pytest-cov for coverage testing.  [/tests/conftest.py](/tests/conftest.py) defines config used by the tests.

API testing is organised under the `tests/` directory (for example `test_main.py`, `test_classify.py`, `test_result.py`) and marked with the `api` pytest marker.

```bash
make api-tests
```

Unit testing for utility functions is in `tests/test_utils.py` and other `tests/test_*.py` modules marked with the `utils` pytest marker.

```bash
make unit-tests
```

All tests can be run using

```bash
make all-tests
```
